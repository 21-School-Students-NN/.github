# Welcome to 21 School Students NN <span><img style="height: 1em;" src="../misc/heart.gif"></span>

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of **21 School Students NN** ‚Äî a team of enthusiastic learners from the Russian version of the globally known **42 School** program.

## ‚ú® Who We Are

We are students of **21 School**, a peer-to-peer coding school in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. 21 School is based on the innovative model of **42 School**, a worldwide network of programming schools with no teachers and no formal classes. Learning here is driven by collaboration, persistence, and project-based experience.

## üåü Our Purpose

This organization serves as a public space for sharing our learning journey, showcasing our coding projects, and demonstrating our problem-solving approaches.

We don't aim to make it easier for others to pass school tasks ‚Äî instead, we:

* Share our solutions **openly** to present the **quality** of our work
* Use GitHub as a **team portfolio**
* Highlight our **teamwork skills** and **individual growth**

## üè¢ What You'll Find Here

* Our personal and group projects
* Solution repositories from the 21 School curriculum
* Code that reflects our journey from beginners to future professionals

## ‚öñÔ∏è Our Principles

* **Transparency** ‚Äî our code is public to show how we think and grow
* **Collaboration** ‚Äî teamwork is central to how we learn and improve
* **Integrity** ‚Äî we don‚Äôt publish code to encourage copying, but to encourage inspiration and feedback
* **Growth** ‚Äî learning never stops, and every repo is a step forward

## ‚ú® Join the Journey

Even if you're not from 21 School, feel free to explore our work. If you're part of the 42/21 ecosystem or simply someone who loves learning through code, we‚Äôd love to connect!

**Made by learners. Shared with purpose.**
